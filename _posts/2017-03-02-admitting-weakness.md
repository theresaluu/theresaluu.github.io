When technical conference speaker and amazing digital mentor, Sarah Mei,
admitted in a [Tweet](https://twitter.com/sarahmei/status/835927143833985024)
that she confuses "has_one" and "belongs_to" even as a senior developer, my socks
were knocked off.  In the past few days, I've seen Twitter accounts admit to not
nailing down a particular topic, given their experience.  It's been inspiring.
This gives the Imposter Syndrome conversation to a pulse- a heartbeat.  I jumped
into the RT cycle by declaring my own small
[victory](https://twitter.com/sarahmei/status/835927143833985024): after almost
four years of being a web developer, CSS does not make me nervous anymore!

I hesitated to Tweet this, for sure. Future employers and future students that I
will work with will read this.  "She is a fraud, for shizzle!" is the reaction
I could hear echo in all of the land.  I hit "Tweet".  Meh, I figured, If I was
was going to get raise eyebrows for anything, it would probably be for one of
the occasions when I've broadcasted my emotionally charged political views in
140-characters not for this.  The response I got was both anti-climatic and
heart-warming.  Nothing blew up back at me, I got a few likes, and someone even
called me a superhero because CSS still gave them anxiety. <3.

CSS is always the first thing to be presented in a web development course/
tutorial track.  People always seemed to nailed it first and moved on to
JavaScript.  What was wrong with me if I was great at Rails and JavaScript but
couldn't work myself around a float/clearfix situation?  It was a bruise to my
ego that steered me away from trying to dive deeper into the subject.

CSS is still not my strongest bulletin point in my resume but I can make my way
around it, and I'm excited what this spirit of experimentation will bring me.
I am not only writing more CSS, but I also caught myself refactoring  my CSS.
Wut wut!!!
