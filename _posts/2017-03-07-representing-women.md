When I became a developer, it was more than just embarking on a new field.
There is the part that I love: the sense of adventure and the opportunity to
solve problems.  But there is always the burden of feeling the need to
"represent" all women.

Four years later, I still struggle with how to "represent" well while still
carving out time to practice my craft and excel.  Do I want to speak on a panel
about being a woman in tech or do I want to stay at home to fiddle with my side
projects and gain more experience?  How do I go to a meetup and get to
participate in the technical discussion while also avoid being cornered and
either hit on or grilled about how complex my problems are at work?  When is
tidying up the kitchen being a courteous coworker and when is it "fulfilling a
woman's duty"?  Do you see me taking notes at this meeting as a sign of my
thoroughness, or do you presume I'm the "team secretary" because my gender
stereotypically plays one on TV?

I recently had an informational meeting with a college student who was
interested in picking my brain about being an engineer at a startup.  I LOL'ed
(IRL) when he asked me if it was true that there is a lot of sexism in the
industry still. I explained that *I have been lucky enough to work with many
men who have been instrumental to my growth as an engineer* but sexism is
systemic in our industry as it does in our culture.

**What have I done about it**? I *steer work conversations away from jumping to
conclusions about people based on what their perceived identities* are.  This
**always feels like it's not enough** or that it goes no where but if I'm not
at least doing this small gesture, I've already failed anyone I'm hoping to
represent or ally with.  I *mentor both male and female coders*.  **Some may
think that men don't need anymore mentoring but how will men ever learn to work
alongside women if women are not open to showing them how**?  To be honest, I
struggle to represent women, myself, because I have never worked with another
woman developer before.  I know some *amazing* women in tech but they are a
community outside of my day to day.  I look forward to the day someone can show
me how to work alongside another woman.

Where does this leave me? Only finding two examples is not good enough.

I've had meaningful conversations with several developer friends about how
succeeding in tech means so much more than what you commit on your repo.  Social
and empathy skills really is the thread that holds it all together.  In order to
create the culture that reduces the pressure for any person to represent an
entire segment of a population, we are going to have to do this iteratively and
incrementally.

I'm here to listen.  Tap my shoulder, and I'll close this laptop for you.
