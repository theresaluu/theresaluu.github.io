**Rubynista**: 
1. (noun, sometimes proper but most of the time not) me
2. (verb) a general description of activities relating to building with code, learning methods to improve the craft of coding, reading OPC (other people's code) and/or tech articles, and community-building.

Happy New Years, guys! 

As a person who came from non-coding roots, I used to cast the social element of this open-source community as a "habit" I had to hide in the attic in order for me to concentrate on leveling up with my newly found craft.  This year, I am embracing it as a necessary element of a Rubynista and my growth as a developer.  Cheers to a year in which I will welcome participating in open source projects, mentorship, going to meetups/speaking events, and participating in group-learning.
