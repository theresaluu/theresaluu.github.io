excerpt: The bastard tried to keep my mixedtapes but I still won.

This week has been the lightest week of my life- after over 10 years, I quit Facebook.  That's right.  The thing we had started in college: very innocent at first- he helped me form study groups.  As we got to know each other better, he changed into this over-reaching beast.  He became my obligation instead of my inspiration.

I've heard other people express their concern about him, but it wasn't until I listened to [Note To Self](http://www.wnyc.org/story/walter-kirn-paranoid-crazy/) that I decided I was done.  Previously, I didn't worry too much about my privacy rights because all the convenience I reaped was worth any data these apps were mining from my posts.  I didn't have anything more to hide than a few toga pics from the early 2000s worth exploiting anyway, and who doesn't have those?

The talking point that really hammered the nail in the coffin was when Walter Kirn pointed out that our information could be and probably was being used to help the powers that be form political campaigns tailored to prompt my political action either one way or another.  Oh no you don't.  You can embarrass me at work by always showing [meundies](https://www.meundies.com) ads while I'm looking up stuff on Stack Overflow because I clicked on a banner once months ago, but you do not mess with my political tendencies.

The main reason why I remained with Facebook for so long was because he had almost all my photos from the last decade of my life, but I've recently adopted a very minimalistic lifestyle.  Purging is becoming second-nature.  That was no longer going to be a crutch.  

The only difficulty I ran into was that Facebook tried to keep my 94 mixtapes (aka, my Spotify account that had 94 playlists)!  It took several days but the wonderful folks at Spotify ported my musical life from my Facebook-linked account to my new one.  It's almost done- not quite yet, but I feel so much better already.  

Why am I telling you this overly (but not so overly) dramatic story about life AFB (after Facebook)?  Well, Internet, now that I'm not involved with that clingy time-suck anymore, I hope to be on here more often.  Where have I been?  Ehhh, I just got out of a situation where I told some algorithm my hopes/dreams/heart- if you really want to know, buy me a beer.

What I will disclose is what happened with my roadblocks from my first post:

First, I got my domain over to Google Domains, and then I wrestled with it (on and off) for another 2 weeks before I could get the setup correct.: Two weeks sounds like a long time but after work, yoga, life, two weeks sounds just right to me.  

Secondly, I decided I was just going ot explicitly state my excerpts for my posts, instead of let it capture the actual text of the beggining of my posts.  Admittedly, it was easier to do than to troubleshoot Redcarpet, but it allows me more creative license to say whatever fitting in my previews from the index page.  

What will be a win for me between now and my next post?  Currently, this post doesn't show up on my index but it shows up in my top nav.  Not good.  But SESO (Ship Early Ship Often).  Wish me luck!

****update****
Holla- ya, girl found out what was wrong before I even deployed.  Fist-bump, booty-bump.  I made this post while already using VIM, and not paying attention to where I was in the tree structure.  Opps.  The fix was to move the post within the jekyll /_posts folder.  All good.  

New win for me between now and my next post will be fixing the alignment/spacing of the blog index page and also, dynamically rendering my top-nav because I don't need to see the About link when I'm already on that page.  

****update (March 10, 2015)****
I am returning to Facebook.  I don't think I'm going to be his friend without restrictions; I think I am going to friend him with limited access to my profile.  ;P see what I did there?  So meta...  
I still have concerns about letting FB farm the details of my life, but in eliminating it from my social repertoire has prevented me from accessing several groups that I interact with in real life.  Since my intention for 2016 is to be more involved in developer communities, I am going to intentionally use FB for that reason (as well as the other groups I'm involved with).
