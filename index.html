        <h3>Focus.  Self-Reflection.</h3>
        <p>
          I can't remember if those values are what lead me to become a web
          developer or if they were by-products of the hours and hours I've
          spent scoping, planning, excuting, evaluating, and delivering
          projects.  Whether it be assessing the placement of my potted plant
          garden after a rainstorm or examining the efficiency of execution of
          a dinner party menu, I regularly find opportunities to perform
          retrospectives outside of a white board environment.  Focusing on wins
          to be grateful for and areas that can be tweaked in order to propel me
          to my desired direction cements a foundation by which I can build upon
          in all of these areas.
